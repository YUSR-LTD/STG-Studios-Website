<p>Privacy Policy for STG Studios
Last Updated: 2025/10/24

At STG Studios, your privacy is our priority. We believe in being completely transparent about our practices.

1. Strict No-Data-Collection Policy
We are proud to state that we have a strict no-data-collection policy. This means:

We do not collect any personal information (like names, emails, addresses).

We do not collect any non-personal or technical information (like device type, IP addresses, or gameplay analytics).

We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking tools in our games or on our website.

Your game experience is entirely private. We don't know what device you're on, how you play, or any other data about you.

2. Third-Party Platforms
Our games may be distributed on platforms like Steam, the Apple App Store, or Google Play. These platforms have their own privacy policies for the purchase and download process, which are outside of our control. We encourage you to review their policies. However, once you are playing our game, we do not collect any data from you.

3. Children's Privacy
Our games are designed to be safe for all ages. Our strict no-data-collection policy ensures we do not gather information from anyone, including children.</p>
